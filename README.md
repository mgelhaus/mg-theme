MG\Theme
===

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `MG\Theme`, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

Getting Started
---------------

* Search for: `'MG\Theme'` and replace with: `'megatherium'`

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` and the links in `footer.php` with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
